#### Create an encyclopedia of random data of 300 words ( either create it in a text file and import the data in the program later or create it in the program itself ) and then find out from these data the followings :
1. The number of letters in these 300 words (spaces included as well).
2. The Repeated words in these 300 words.
3. The longest word in these 300 words.
4. The shortest word in these 300 words.
5. The repetition number of each word in these 300 words.

First write a non-threaded version and see how long it takes in time to Extract these data and then write it again but this time with a muilti-threaded version and calculate the speed up ( in milliseconds ) it took from the non-threaded one.
Use the following functions with these exact names :
1. Count : for the number of letters.
2. repeatedwords : for the words repeated.
3. longest: for the longest word.
4. shortest: for the shortest word.
5. Repeat: for the number of times each word appeared.

These methods will be implemented using Rmi (Remote method invocation) but in the local machine.
